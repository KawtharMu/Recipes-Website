# Recipes-Website
This website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP as well as using Bootstrap.
Once entering the website, if the user isn't signed in they get taken to the sign in page, in order to be able to view the websites contents the user must sign in first, the email and password are saved in an array, the array can be found in the folder "users".
Once the user is signed in a session is started and when pressing "remember me" box a cookie is created which lasts for 7 days.
The list of recipes is built using bootstrap so that it can be responsive depending on the screen size, and the recipes can be ordered in an ascending or descending order using JavaScript.
JavaScript was also used to show the user's password instead of dots once clicking on the eye icon if the user chooses to do so.
